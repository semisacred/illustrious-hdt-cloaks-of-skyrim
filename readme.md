# Illustrious HDT Cloaks of Skyrim

## Description

This mod converts **non-HDT cloaks from Cloaks of Skyrim** into **HDT-enabled cloaks** when they enter the player’s inventory.

- HDT cloaks apply to the **player and followers**
- **NPCs are not affected**, avoiding common HDT performance and glitch issues
- Designed as a lightweight alternative to full HDT replacers

This was created to retain the excellent visuals of HDT cloaks while preventing NPC physics glitches and performance drops in busy areas.

> **Note:** Cloaks behave exactly like bola08’s HDT version, but without NPC application.  
> If you want a full replacer, use the original mod instead.
